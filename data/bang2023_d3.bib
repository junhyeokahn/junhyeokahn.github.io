ABSTRACT={In this paper, we introduce a new teen-size humanoid platform dubbed DRACO 3, custom-built by Apptronik and altered for practical use by the Human Centered Robotics Lab at The University of Texas at Austin. The form factor of DRACO 3 is such that it can operate safely in human environments while reaching objects at human heights. To approximate the range of motion of humans, this robot features proximal actuation and mechanical artifacts to provide a high range of hip, knee and ankle motion. In particular, rolling contact mechanisms on the lower body are incorporated using a proximal actuation principle to provide an extensive vertical pose workspace.To enable DRACO 3 to perform dexterous tasks while dealing with these complex transmissions, we introduce a novel whole-body controller (WBC) incorporating internal constraints to model rolling motion behavior. In addition, details of our WBC controller for DRACO 3 are presented with an emphasis on practical points for hardware implementation. We perform a design analysis of DRACO 3, as well as empirical evaluations under the lens of the Centroidal Inertia Isotropy (CII) design metric. Lastly, we validate our design and controller experimentally by testing Center of Mass (CoM) balancing, one-leg balancing, and stepping-in-place behaviors.}}
